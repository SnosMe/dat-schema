## Schema

The schema is based on GraphQL syntax.

### Supported scalar types

| Type              | Description                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| bool              | Boolean                           |
| string            | String                            |
| u64, u32, u16, u8 | Unsigned Integer                  |
| i64, i32, i16, i8 | Signed Integer                    |
| f64, f32          | Floating Point Number             |
| rid               | Index to a Row in a Foreign Table |

The `rid` type is intended to be used temporarily until we know the name of foreign table.

The other type for temporary use is `_`, which is only allowed inside array `[_]`.
You will find it useful if you know that a column is an array but don't know of which type (because they are all zero-length).

### Defining relations

- Using a row index

  Example `BaseItem: BaseItemTypes`

- Using a matching value in column (like in relational databases)

  Example `SkillId: ActiveSkills @ref(column: "Id")`

### Supported directives

| Directive  | Arguments | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| @ref       | column: "STRING" - name of referenced column | Defines relation |
| @unique    | -         | All values in a column are different |
| @localized | -         | Content of column differs depending on the language |
| @file      | ext: "STRING" | Value in a column is a file path |
| @files     | ext: list of "STRING" | Value in a column is a common prefix for several files (often with different extensions) |
